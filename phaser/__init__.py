""" phaser - a library to simplify automated batch-oriented complex data integration pipelines

`Pipeline` : organizes a data pipeline into multiple phases, each with checkpoints so that the pipeline can be
continued from any phase.

`Phase` : Organizes the work of a complicated pipeline into a smaller unit. It still contains multiple steps and
column definitions/fixes, but it can be run standalone from its input data and have its output examined as both
a checkpoint and input to the next phase.

PipelineErrorException, DropRowException, WarningException : these exceptions can be used in custom steps to
define what should happen when the exception is raised.

`row_step`, `batch_step` : These are decorators used to wrap custom steps so they can be called by a Phase with the
right input data, and check the output and handle exceptions.

check_unique, sort_by : Built-in steps that can be declared to operate on a column, and included in the steps of
a Phase.

Column, IntColumn, DateColumn, DateTimeColumn : Define column instances by name and type, and pass them to the Phase to
have datatype casting and name canonicalization done automatically.

# Note: not sure this documentation is going to stay here.   There is  advice to put module documentation in the
# module's __init__.py file [here](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/)
# but that may be more relevant for smaller modules.  We should also consider readthedocs.io but that's a big
# commitment to build for that.
